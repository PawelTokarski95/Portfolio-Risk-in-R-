#PORTFOLIO RISK IN R
The project's objective was to create a diversified investment portfolio using stocks from different companies and industries. Its risk level was to be analyzed, with a focus on identifying markets (developed or emerging) with lower risks and suitable for investment.
To achieve this goal, I studied ETFs that measure market indices. Of course, the macroeconomic situation was also taken into account (2022).

After thorough analysis, I concluded that investing in developed markets would be a better opportunity. As such, I selected well-known American brands such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google (around a dozen in total). 
I also had to assess the risk, so for that, measures such as Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall are needed. It is worth mentioning something like Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall. Value at Risk (VaR) 
measures the boundary level of losses at a certain probability level. It is a commonly used measure for calculating risk. Expected Shortfall (ES) is a measure of the average loss that can be expected within Value at Risk, so you could say it is the 'worst loss' scenario.

The Value at Risk at a probability level of 5% is approximately 6000 dollars, while the expected shortfall is 11.000 dollars. In summary, portfolio risk is rather high in context of measurements, 
especially if the potential investor wants to invest in the assets in the future. As seen in the past, there can be various unexpected macroeconomic situations such as the coronavirus pandemic 
and the war in Ukraine. That is the main issue - high unpredictability today. Therefore, there should be an awareness of potential threats.
